    <h2>Welcome to My Corner of the Internet!</h2>
    <p>
      It's brill to have you be able to view my website. It's pretty bare bones at the moment and purely self inspired.
      Hence, web designs as if it's the early 2000s, sunset oranges, potentially inconsistent themes and minimal front-end design.
      Over time, I'm hoping this will grow mostly to reflect my passions in the world of Computer Science, my growth within the field
      and quite a few things more. It may not be much to look at yet, but it's certainly a start.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      It seems to be law to have a form of about me on any personal website, so here's mine in brief:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science Student in my final year at the University of Exeter. Recently I finished working on a Multi-Objective
      Genetic Algorithm for my Final Year Project. In Computer Science, my interests mostly revolve around Artificial Intelligence,
      lower-level languages and Integrating Software with Hardware. My hobbies seem to change roughly every year, so I'll forego a list,
      But primarily I'm a swimmer, Salsero and Bachatero, reader, cook and strategy game player. Oh, and my favourite colour is orange if you
      couldn't tell.
    </p>

    <h2>Keep With the Times</h2>
    <p>
      It's amazing that you came to check out my site, hopefully you think it's pretty cool. If you do, I've tried to make it a bit easier to
      keep up to date with what im doing. I'm not quite at a newsletter level, there's just not enough here, and they're not really something im into.
      Instead, try following my RSS Feed. If you don't know what RSS is, there's loads of explanations online, but long story short it's a way of having a
      personalised feed with no ads, algorithms or attention grabbing.
      You can find it <a href="feed.xml"> here!</a>
