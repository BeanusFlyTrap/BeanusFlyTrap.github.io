    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Back in 2022, around March-time, I was looking for an Industrial Placement role. Having made a quite large number of applications
I thought to use the advice of most random computer Scientists on the Internet. Build a website. Having done a single module about web development
in my first year of University I thought it was a piece of cake. By the end of the day I had a basic template (The one still being used now),
a small amount of content, and some links to my project.</p>

<p>After all of this something became very clear. The website had just become a tedious way of linking to GitHub Projects individually, and it
would be much more efficient to just link my GitHub to my CV. So on the basis it was probably negatively impacting my CV anyway, it was replaced
with a straight link to GitHub. At this point a whole 2 weeks after its creation, the project was effectively abandoned. In fact this was done so
quickly it was left hosting a “Website under construction” page to the odd hacker that came around.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: It did actually get hacked too. I’m unsure as to how but around a year ago I remembered the sites existence to
find someone else’s page in its place (Bringing great joy to my colleagues). I won’t list the hosting platform here, purely
from lack of knowledge as to how it actually occurred.</p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>

<p>This brings us to the modern day, March 2024. With a Dissertation due in two months, taking a bit of time out to build up a website seems
a bit counter-productive. But I think its proving a nice break from “Death by Algebra”. My reasoning for coming back to the site is quite simple really,
“Practise what you preach”. Without a rant, essentially I wanted to create a home for my projects to exist that wasn’t just a portfolio or any attempt
at an attention grab. It can help motivate some effort into some projects, showcase the works I have done, and hopefully people who come across it
might take some inspiration, you never know.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-not-a-front-end-developer">I am not a Front-End Developer</h2>

<p>I have never been shy about a very simple fact. I don’t enjoy front-end development. It can be quite tedious to do, quite time-consuming without much experience,
and I’m not a graphic designer. That being said I also didn’t want the site to look entirely out of the 1990s, so I’ve tried my best. At the end of the day it is supposed
to be a bit personal, hence the orange color scheme purely as a fact of it being my favourite color. If you spot anything that doesn’t line up properly
feel free to reach out, or add an issue to the GitHub or however that works, and throw in a solution if you’re feeling it.</p>

<h2 id="the-development-process">The Development Process</h2>

<p>Since the initial conception, a lot of the development process has been forgotten. But what I can say is that the Site is hosted using GitHub Pages.
The vast majority of the site is based on things I have seen and liked, or my own ideas. I have not used any Large-Language Models to aid the creation
of the site. There was an attempt to work on the CSS using one of the popular LLM’s, but the outcome wasn’t really that great. So back to good ol’ fasioned google and stack Overflow.</p>

<h2 id="technologies-used">Technologies Used</h2>

<p>Without too much detail, the technologies used for this project are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>PHP -&gt; Since Removed</li>
  <li>Git -&gt; Using GitHub as a Store</li>
  <li>GitHub Pages -&gt; For Hosting</li>
  <li>RSS -&gt; For People who might want to keep up to date</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-developments">Future Developments</h2>

<p>As someone who tends to work using an iterative process the exact future developments are unknown. Most likely they will involve
fleshing out the site, such as Past Projects, Contact Details, etc. And Ultimately some form of overhaul if it ever gets too big,
or I finally decided to give my graphic design career a second-glance.</p>
