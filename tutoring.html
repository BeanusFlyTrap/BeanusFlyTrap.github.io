    <h2>Tutoring</h2>
    <p>
      Well, I'm planning to do tutoring, I'm prioritising my final year of University until Summer of 2024.

    <p>
      But there's no harm in early advertising.
      I will be available from around June 2024 for any of the following subjects:
      <ul>
        <li> Maths   </li>
        <li> Physics </li>
        <li> Computer Science   </li>
      </ul>
      I am happy to tutor maths and physics up to A-Level, with Computer Science to University Standard
