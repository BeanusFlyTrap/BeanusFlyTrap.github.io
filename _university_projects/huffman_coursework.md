## Theory

Back in 2022, around March-time, I was looking for an Industrial Placement role. Having made a quite large number of applications
I thought to use the advice of most random computer Scientists on the Internet. Build a website. Having done a single module about web development
in my first year of University I thought it was a piece of cake. By the end of the day I had a basic template (The one still being used now),
a small amount of content, and some links to my project

## The Development Process

Since the initial conception, a lot of the development process has been forgotten. But what I can say is that the Site is hosted using GitHub Pages.
The vast majority of the site is based on things I have seen and liked, or my own ideas. I have not used any Large-Language Models to aid the creation
of the site. There was an attempt to work on the CSS using one of the popular LLM's, but the outcome wasn't really that great. So back to good ol' fasioned google and stack Overflow.

## Technologies Used

Without too much detail, the technologies used for this project are:
* Python
