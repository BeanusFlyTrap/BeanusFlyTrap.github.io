  <h2>Shower Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    I'm not fully sure how this page is going to end up turning out. Potentially it will take on a similar form to the
    projects section. I quite like the idea of it being somewhat a penny for your thoughts sort of thing, where those random
    thoughts you have while in the shower, or on the train, etc, can live. Although I am neither an expert, nor much of an innovator,
    so maybe it will end up as a projects' graveyard. Only time can tell.
