            <h2>Welcome to My Corner of the Internet!</h2>
            <p>It's brill to have you be able to view my website. It's something which is mostly
              inspired by my own preference, such as the orange colour scheme. Over time, I'm hoping this will grow to reflect
              my aptitude and passion in the world of Computer Science, and my growth within the field over time as well. I realise the
              site isn't much to look at yet, but it's certainly a start.
            </p>
            <h2>Keep Up to Date</h2>
            <p>
              I really appreciate your bring here as mentioned above, but what would be incredible is if you could keep up to date with the
              stuff I happen to get up to. Not to worry though, there's no annoying newsletter to fill up you inbox. Instead, try following my RSS Feed
              If you don't know what RSS is, there's loads of explanations online, but long story short it's a way of having a
              personalised feed with no ads, algorithms or attention grabbing
              You can find it <a href="feed.xml"> here!</a>
