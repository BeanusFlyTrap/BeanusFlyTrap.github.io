                    I'm not fully sure how this page is going to end up turning out. Potentially it will take on a similar form to the
                    projects section. I quite like the idea of it being somewhat a penny for your thoughts sort of thing, where those random
                    thoughts you have while in the shower, or on the train, etc, can live. Although I am neither an expert, nor much of an innovator
                    so maybe it will end up as a projects graveyard. Only time can tell.
