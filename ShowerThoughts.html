                <h2>New Year 2022</h2>
                <p> As the New Year begins, as we all do, we think about the future. 
                    We plan New year's resolutions to better ourselves, "This year, we shall be better" we say.
                    Although the vast majority of us barely manage to carry these through till Febuary, myself included,
                    I still believe that it is important for us to make these promises to ourselves, not neccesarily to carry them through
                    but to reatin an optimism for the future.</p>
                <p> 
                    Anyway, this year, to try to encourage me to exceed my goals and resolutions for the year, I thought i'd include some here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To use git,through Github, more for projects</li>
                        <li>To continue learning mandarin</li>
                        <li>To learn languages in the C family</li>
                        <li>To regularly update and build upon this site</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </article>
        </main>
        <footer class = "footer">
