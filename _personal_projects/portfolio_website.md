## Background

This Portfolio website is quite a long time in the making. It was started in 2022 whilst I was looking for an Industrial PLacement experiance, with the goal of impressing employers with a portfolio of my work. After doing an initial landing page and moving onto the actual projects section, I soon realised that it was serving no purpose other then being a more awkward way to link to Github Repositories. 

Now in 2024, having graduated university, I wanted to revisit the project. I wanted to create a professional looking site that showcased my work. This time a proper development approach would be taken, starting with the design and layout of the website, with the content of the site to follow. By doing so, it would also allow me to reflect on the projects created at university and during my spare time, thinking about the skills I've learned. 

## Development Overview

The development of the site has mostly followed a waterfall like approach. First a pen and paper sketch of the page alyouts was made, and colors selected for the site. I then looked into the technologies that could make the development of the site much easier. Things such as hosting providers and site creation tools. 

Being a free platform that i counsider quite trustworthy, I decided to use Github Pages as a hosting platform. This indirectly influened the selection of site creation tool. Remembering the pains of managing large numbers of links across even a small number of pages, I wanted to find a tool that made site management easier, but also allow the creation of the site in pure code form. Being supported by Github Pages, Jekyll seemed ideal as it fit all the above criteria. 

The base of the site was created, powered by Jekyll. A default template for all pages was made, alongside the creation of a collection for projects, to allow the auto-generation of the Projects pages. The design of the page did vary slightly from its origninal drawings, but mostly small aesthetic changes, such as a white instead of clementine background. 

Once I was happy with the layout, aswell as getting a bit bored with graphic design. I began to fill out the content. The Projects collection came in really handy, since it meant the majority of pages could be written in simple markdown, and the pages automatically generated. 

## Technologies Used

Without too much detail, the technologies used for this project are:

* HTML
* CSS
* Ruby
* Jeyll
* GitHub Repo & Pages
* RSS

## Lessons Learned
The biggest lessons learned on this project were how to use Ruby, Ruby Gems and the importance of being able to debug command line errors. 


## Future Developments

Having added the majority of previous work to the site, I am happy with the look and content of the site. As such I dont think there is a current need to develop the site further. This will allow me to work on new projects using the skills and abilities reflected upon in the sites creation. As such, updates will continue with the addition of new work, or ammendments to prior work.
