              A Side-Project that began in my first year of University, and is only being finished in my fourth.
              At this point it actually has somewhat of a story behind it with some lessons learned. I'd hope that
              this one somewhat speaks for itself, although I've still made a thing about it cause why not.

            Unfortunately I haven't finished this year yet so can't include any projects until September due to University policy
            Or at least what i believe university policy to be, i havent really looked into it
