          <h2>Huffman Encoding</h2>
          <p>
            Arguably, this is the piece of work I'm most proud of. The project consisted of the conception
            and development of a text compression algorithm, alongside a corresponding literature review of both 
            compression algorithms in general and an analysis of the application created. It involved research,
            an iterative approach to optimisation, and performance analysis.

          <h2>Covid Booking App</h2>
          <p>
            This project was the first object-oriented application I completed in Java. The purpose of the coursework was
            to create a test booking system for a university that was aiding the NHS in conducting Track and trace testing.

          <h2>PebbleGame</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of my most recent pieces of work, and is a demonstration of an ability to work using 
            paired programming. The premise of the coursework was to apply threading to handle multiple elements of a 
            game involving pebbles. Overall, each 'player' in the game is represented by a thread, and those threads had to
            be handled in a way that players turn alternated.
